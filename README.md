# DCC_2021
This is my solution to the different challenges from The Danish Cyber Championship, nationals.
Disclaimer, this was my third CTF ever and the two predeccors being the Qvalifiers and Regionals.
For the DDC writeups i will be writing in danish, and i will document the process. I am only sharing
few challenges i solved.

The writeups are mostly for documenting my own progress and reflecting back on the progress. As stated
in the writing moment i am brand new to CTF, and that is why it seems to me like great practice to get 
thoughts and solutions written down.
